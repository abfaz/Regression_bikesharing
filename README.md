## Project Name - Bike Sharing Demand Prediction


## Project Description
Currently Rental bikes are introduced in many urban cities for the enhancement of mobility comfort. It is important to make the rental bike available and accessible to the public at the right time as it lessens the waiting time. Eventually, providing the city with a stable supply of rental bikes becomes a major concern. The crucial part is the prediction of bike count required at each hour for the stable supply of rental bikes.

## Project Summary
**The bike sharing demand prediction project aims to develop a predictive model to forecast the demand for bike rentals in a specific city or region. The project will leverage historical data on bike usage, weather conditions, and other relevant factors to train a predictive model that can accurately forecast the number of bike rentals for futre time periods.**

**The project will involve data inspection, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering/data preprocessing and model training and evaluation. Various machine learning algorithims, such as regression, decision tree, and Random forest, will be tested and evaluated to determine the best-performing model.**

**The ultimate goal of the project is to provide bike-sharing service providers and city officials with accurate demand forecasts that can help them optimize bike availability, allocate resources efficiently, and improve the overall user experience.**
